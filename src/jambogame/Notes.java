		/*So I think the Y height was so screwed up because I was using the frame pack, 
		 * which made the frame the size of all the components, and the grass rectangle 
		 * was set to 550 = y and height = 100... so its final screenHeight would have ended up being 650
		 * 
		 * so the draw function for my wall building user interface is challenging, i am going to have to reasign initial and final
		 * points because you can not use negative width as a parameter 
		 * 
		 * level's order 1: learn the ropes(show the player the death and paint
		 * mechanic) 2: harder maze 3: random ball bounce patrol agent 4:
		 * 
		 * ideas: switch the controls to inverse try make a button that when
		 * pressed explodes
		 * 
		 * have a guardian patroling the maze, if they see you in their sight
		 * lines, they will shoot slow moving pelets at you on flip side they
		 * show you how to move through the maze
		 * 
		 * Improvements yet to be made:
		 * XXXadd borders
		 * XXXfix movement glitches
		 * add wall objects
		 * make objects kill when in 
		 * reset ball after collision
		 * paint wall objects after being hit
		 * make modular title cards to play between levels
		 * make escape pull up a menu
